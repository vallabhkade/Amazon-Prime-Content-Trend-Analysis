Objective: The analysis explores trends in Amazon Prime's content, focusing on key variables such as movie and TV show types, release years, genres, and ratings.

Data Insights:

Content Ratio: There is a nearly balanced ratio of movies and TV shows on Amazon Prime.
Content Over Time: A spike in the number of releases was observed after 2010, with a consistent focus on recent years.
Genre Popularity: Drama, Comedy, and Action dominate the content library. These genres appeal to a wide range of audiences.
Content Ratings: The majority of the content is rated for general audiences, with an emphasis on PG and PG-13 ratings.
Data Handling: Missing values, outliers, and data cleaning were a key part of this project. Fields like 'cast', 'country', and 'date_added' had high percentages of missing data and were dropped or filled.

Technologies Used:

Pandas and NumPy: For data manipulation and cleaning.
Matplotlib and Seaborn: For visualizing trends (e.g., genre distribution, release year analysis, rating distribution).
Python: General scripting for data analysis and handling missing values.
